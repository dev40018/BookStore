Let me explain the @Lazy annotation in Spring, which plays an important role in controlling when beans are initialized in your application.

By default, Spring creates all singleton beans eagerly when the application context starts up. Think of it like preparing all ingredients before starting to cook. However, sometimes you might want to "prepare an ingredient" only when you actually need it â€“ that's where @Lazy comes in.

Let's explore this with a practical example. Imagine you have a heavy database migration service that you only need occasionally:

```java
// Without @Lazy - created at startup
@Service
public class DatabaseMigrationService {
    public DatabaseMigrationService() {
        // Heavy initialization
        System.out.println("DatabaseMigrationService is being created...");
        // Might take several seconds to initialize
    }
}

// With @Lazy - created only when needed
@Service
@Lazy
public class DatabaseMigrationService {
    public DatabaseMigrationService() {
        // Won't be created until first request
        System.out.println("DatabaseMigrationService is being created...");
    }
}
```

The @Lazy annotation can be used in several different contexts. Let's look at each one:

1. On a Component or Bean:
```java
@Component
@Lazy
public class ExpensiveService {
    public ExpensiveService() {
        // This constructor won't be called until the service is first requested
        performExpensiveInitialization();
    }
}
```

2. On Dependencies (Field Injection):
```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    // This dependency won't be created until userService.processData() is called
    @Autowired
    @Lazy
    private ExpensiveDataProcessor dataProcessor;
    
    public void processData() {
        dataProcessor.process(); // ExpensiveDataProcessor is created here
    }
}
```

3. On Configuration Classes:
```java
@Configuration
@Lazy
public class AnalyticsConfig {
    @Bean
    public AnalyticsService analyticsService() {
        // All beans in this configuration will be lazy by default
        return new AnalyticsService();
    }
}
```

Let's see a more complex example that demonstrates the practical benefits of @Lazy:

```java
@Service
public class EmailService {
    private final EmailValidator validator;
    private final SpamChecker spamChecker;
    private final EmailFormatter formatter;
    
    // Only the expensive SpamChecker is lazy
    public EmailService(
            EmailValidator validator,
            @Lazy SpamChecker spamChecker,
            EmailFormatter formatter) {
        this.validator = validator;
        this.spamChecker = spamChecker;
        this.formatter = formatter;
    }
    
    public void sendEmail(String content) {
        // Basic validation happens first
        validator.validate(content);
        
        // Format the email
        String formatted = formatter.format(content);
        
        // Spam checking only happens for certain types of emails
        if (needsSpamCheck(formatted)) {
            // SpamChecker is initialized only when this code runs
            spamChecker.check(formatted);
        }
        
        // Send the email...
    }
}
```

However, it's important to understand the trade-offs of using @Lazy:

1. Application Startup: Using @Lazy can make your application start faster since not all beans are initialized immediately.

2. First Request Latency: The first time a lazy bean is needed, there will be a delay as Spring creates and initializes it. This could cause a noticeable pause in your application.

3. Error Detection: With eager initialization, configuration errors are detected at startup. With lazy initialization, you might not discover these errors until the bean is first used.

Here's an example showing how lazy initialization might affect error detection:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    @Lazy
    public DatabaseService databaseService(
            @Value("${db.url}") String url) {
        // If db.url is missing, you won't know until the first database operation
        return new DatabaseService(url);
    }
}
```
